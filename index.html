                    <p> Hi! My name is Bryan Villalon and welcome to my page! </p>

                    <p>
                        I was born in McAllen, Texas but moved here early in life so I consider myself a Houston native.
                        I was homeschooled from 6th through 12th grades but attended college at the University of
                        Houston.
                        In December of 2010, I graduated with a BS in Electrical Engineering with a minor in Nano
                        Engineering.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After briefly flirting with graduate school for silicon processes and VLSI, I began work with
                        Hewlett
                        Packard Enterprise in April 2011 working primarilly on networking cards and switches.
                        Pretty much every networking card that HPE has released in that time frame was either designed
                        by or
                        collaborated on by me.
                        I also did some signal integrity on some of the BladeSystem and Synergy switches and worked on
                        EMC
                        (Electromagnetic Compatibility) for all of the projects I was responsible for.
                    </p>

                    <p> After some time in the corporate world I felt like I needed a break so I quit in April 2019 to
                        begin
                        working with my family's land managment company, TexPLM.
                        My responsibilities include basic IT work, maintaining our website and email, and designing and
                        maintaining databases for our county records.
                        I am also learning GIS to help identify leasing opportunities for us to sell to O&G companies.
                        There
                        is
                        quite a lot to learn!
                    </p>
                    <p>Currently I am taking a course with the University of Texas called Coding Bootcamp and intend on
                        using
                        what I learn to add value to my family's company.
                    </p>

                    <p>On February 2nd, 2019 I proposed to the love of my life, Ashley Towne, after having dated a
                        little
                        over 9
                        months.
                        I knew I wanted to marry her before I asked her out. I get to marry her on October 19th, 2019 at
                        St.
                        John Vianney Catholic Church.</p>

                    <p>
                        I enjoy <em>many</em> things including but not limited to bowling, golf, cooking, watching the
                        Astros
                        and Texans, watching Houston Cougar sports, and general shennanigans.
                        Doing any of these things, you will most certainly see me with an IPA or a glass of rum in
                        either
                        hand.
                    </p>
